Level order traversal

### Queue is important data structure for intermediate nodes to be processed

### Data structures needed

1. one Queue (for ordering things).
2. one visited Array (tracks visited status during exploration phase) / Or use a color enum array for separate states.
3. one distance Array (manages distance from source vertex).
4. (Optional) one parent array to make note of parent from which current vertex was visited/explored
5. Auxillary (parent discovery pointer).

### Initialization and initial vertex s

```py
visited[s] = True
distance[s] = 0
Q.push(s)
```

### Core algorithm

1. start with source node in Queue
2. While Queue has nodes
   1. pop a node from Queue
   2. mark it visited
   3. add its adjacent vertices to the Queue

### Gotchas

1. we mark a node as seen/visited **before adding to the queue**, not after popping from the queue. Why? Marking as visited upon insertion prevents the same node being inserted more than once. try with example 0->1,0->2, 0->3.
2. an adjacent node is only processed if it was not seen/visited before.
### Implementation

```java
List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();// graph representation

int n;// number of nodes
int s; // source start vertex

int[] d = new int[n]; // distnace of each node, index is vertex id
boolean[] seen = new boolean[n]; // whether this vertex was seen/visited/processed
int[] p = new int[n]; // parent discovery vertex for any given vertex

LinkedList<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();// actual queue
q.add(s);
d[s] = 0;// distance of source is 0
p[s] = -1;// marker for source vertex
seen[s] = true;
while(!q.isEmpty()) {
   int u = q.remove();
   for(int v: adj(u)) { // going from u to v
      if(!seen[v]) {
         seen[v] = true;// mark explored/visited - which is equivalent to pushed to the queue once
         p[v] = u;// record parent
         d[v] = d[u]+1;// record distance
         q.push(v);
      }
   }
}
```

## BFS with level distinction

Two loops:
1. outer one to check queue not empty
2. Inner for loop runs for q level size. (must be extracted to a variable first and then looped).



## Multi source BFS
